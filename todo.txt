todo

- better error detection if current layer is locked/hidden
- create swatches relative to current artboard
- detect color tonal value and change swatch text label between black & white for best contrast
- don't generate swatches that are in the "trash" (show up as "deleted swatch")
	- figure out how to reproduce this
- write documentation for swatch generator

ideas

- create/detect layer for swatches
- add option to generate text next to swatch, with smaller swatch
